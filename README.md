# SM64 Input Lua - Encoding Version

This is my personal version of the Input Lua meant to be used for TAS encodes. It aims to make the text easier to read, and add additional, relevant information.

To change the background and text colours, edit the hex codes at the top of `Drawing.lua`

### Changes:
* Shows inputs (buttons being pressed)
* Shows frame number
* Removes buttons used for making TASes
* Makes text bigger
* Spaces out the text
* Y = -0 displays as Y = 0
