# SM64 Input Lua - Encoding Version

This is my personal version of the Input Lua meant to be used for TAS encodes. It aims to make the text easier to read, and add additional, relevant information.

### Changes:
* Shows inputs (buttons being pressed)
* Removes buttons used for making TASes
* Makes text bigger
* Spaces out the text
* Y = -0 displays as Y = 0

The important changes were made in `Drawing.lua`
